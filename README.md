# Scaling
Each directory name corresponds to the number of atoms in each system.

66K : 20 layer, 6 monomer per layer dry system
100K : 20 layer, 6 monomer per layer solvated system
265K : 80 layer, 6 monomer per layer dry system

The .tpr in each subdirectory of 66K, 100K and 265K is identical. The only thing
that will need to be changed is the node configuration
